## Usage

1. Download the file `app_asar_file_v1.x` or ` app_asar_folder_v1.x` corresponding to the Typora version from **Github releases**. 

   **\*\*Remind :** If you download the `app_asar_folder_v1.x`, you need to generate `app.asar` **Manually**. 

   

2. Extract them from the compressed file.

3. **If you download the `app_asar_folder_v1.x`, use these commands below:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mas0nShi/typoraCracker
   git checkout {Typora_version+OS_Platform}
   python -m pip install -r ./typoraCracker/requirements.txt
   python ./typoraCracker/typora.py -u ./dec_app ./outappasar
   ```

   Then you can find `app.asar` in `./outappasar`.

   **If you download the `app_asar_file_v1.x`, skip this step.**

   

4. Copy the file `app.asar` to `{Install_Location}/Typora/resources/app.asar` and **replace** it. 

   In Linux, you can use the command: `sudo cp {app.asar} /usr/share/typora/resources/`.

2. Then enjoy it.
