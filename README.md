# TGreen

Some crack files work well on Txxxxx v1.1 (The latest support v1.8.10/v1.8.3-dev), Based on txxxxxCracker. 查看 **简体中文** 文档请戳 [这里](./README-CN.md) 。查看 **繁體中文** 文档請點擊 [這裡](./README-TW.md) 。



**The latest** original Typora download link :

[Typora — Windows/Linux release channel](https://typora.io/releases/all)



*We have been discovering the new techs, you can find some info below:

- [Delppine - TC](https://github.com/Delppine1024/TC)
- [Yoshino-s - TyporaCracker](https://github.com/Yoshino-s/typoraCracker)
- [Mas0nShi - typoraCracker](https://github.com/Mas0nShi/typoraCracker)

The subsequent crack files maybe change types, and be different from the current ones.



## ATTENTION

**NOTE: Although TGreen provide support for crack, we encourage buying license, in order to Support Genuine Software Development.**



```

```



## Usage

1. Download the file `app_asar_file_v1.x` or ` app_asar_folder_v1.x` corresponding to the Typora version and **OS-platform** from **Github releases**.

   > **Remind :** If you download the `app_asar_folder_v1.x`, you need to generate `app.asar` Manually. Since v1.5.0-dev, `app_asar_folder_v1.x` will **not be supported**.



2. Extract them from the compressed file.

3. **If you download the `app_asar_folder_v1.x`, use these commands below:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mas0nShi/typoraCracker
   git checkout {Typora_version+OS_Platform}
   python -m pip install -r ./typoraCracker/requirements.txt
   python ./typoraCracker/typora.py -u ./dec_app ./outappasar
   ```

   Then you can find `app.asar` in `./outappasar`.

   **If you download the `app_asar_file_v1.x`, skip this step.**



4. Copy the extracted file `app.asar` to `{Install_Location}/Typora/resources/app.asar` and **replace** it.

   On Linux and using default installing method, you can use the command: `sudo cp {app.asar} /usr/share/typora/resources/`.
   
   > **\*If you got extracted file `main.node` and `ex.js`, this means you have downloaded files for Arm OS (It is recommended to try the latest version 1.7.x or newer, you can do the normal steps and escape this tip). You need to copy both files to `{Install_Location}/Typora/resources/app.asar.unpacked/`. These are experimental, which means we need more feedback.  We cannot test them, cause we don’t have any Arm device.**



5. Then enjoy it.
